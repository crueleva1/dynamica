Dynamica is a high performance rigid body simulation plugin for Autodesk Maya based on the open source Bullet Physics framework. Designed to meet the demands of art direction, Dynamica gives artists the control they need to author complex simulations. Primary features include:

 - Active, passive, and kinematic rigid bodies
 - Sphere, Box, Hull(convex), and Mesh(concave) collision shapes
 - Force breakable Nail, Hinge, Slider, and Six-degrees-of-freedom constraints
 - Frame based choreography control
 - Simulation capture (baking)

 / Create \
Create rigid body primitives (Sphere and Box) or arbitrarily shaped rigid bodies based on a set of selected mesh objects. Source meshes must have conformed outward-facing normals to prevent collision shape distortion. An user specified collision margin (under the Options tab) can be adjusted to control collision gaps.

|Active Rigid Bodies
Active rigid bodies are controlled by the simulation solver and react to gravity, collisions, and fields.

Sphere  - creates an active primitive rigid body sphere.
Box     - creates an active primitive rigid body cube.
Hull    - creates an active rigid body hull based on a selected mesh object.
Mesh    - creates an active rigid body mesh based on a selected mesh object.

|Passive Rigid Bodies
Passive rigid bodies do not react to gravity or fields, but are included in collisions. They usually serve as proxy collision shapes for static surfaces in a scene. If passive rigid bodies are keyed and moving, they are considered kinematic - active bodies will collide and react accordingly.

Sphere  - creates a passive primitive rigid body sphere.
Box     - creates a passive primitive rigid body cube.
Hull    - creates a passive rigid body hull based on a selected mesh object.
Mesh    - creates a passive rigid body mesh based on a selected mesh object.
BvhMesh - creates an optimized passive rigid body mesh based on a selected mesh object.
Plane   - creates a passive primitive rigid body plane.

|Active Rigid Body Arrays
Active rigid body arrays are collections of like shaped active rigid bodies. The size of the array is controlled by user input in the Create Rigid Body Array panel.

Sphere  - creates an array of active primitive rigid body spheres.
Box     - creates an array of active primitive rigid body cubes.
Hull    - creates an array of active rigid body hulls based on a selected mesh object.
Mesh    - creates an array of active rigid body meshes based on a selected mesh object.

Note: rigid body arrays may not initially be visible if created on a frame other than the start frame.

|Passive Rigid Body Arrays
Passive rigid body arrays are collections of like shaped passive rigid bodies. The size of the array is controlled by user input in the Create Passive Rigid Body Array panel.

Sphere  - creates an array of passive primitive rigid body spheres.
Box     - creates an array of passive primitive rigid body cubes.
Hull    - creates an array of passive rigid body hulls based on a selected mesh object.
Mesh    - creates an array of passive rigid body meshes based on a selected mesh object.
BvhMesh - creates an array of optimized passive rigid body meshes based on a selected mesh object.
Plane   - creates an array of passive primitive rigid body planes.

|Constraints
Constraints inhibit the natural (unconstrained) behavior of an active rigid body. Constraints require at least one rigid body to be selected. If a pair of rigid bodies is selected, they are constrained to each other. If three or more rigid bodies are selected, they are constrained to each other in a distance sorted sequence - like a chain. Rigid bodies can be influenced by multiple constraints.

Nail    - pins a rigid body in place or to another rigid body and allows free rotation in any direction.
Hinge   - constrains a rigid body in place or to another rigid body and allows rotation about a single axis relative to the z-axis of the constraints transform.
Slider  - constrains the translation of a rigid body along a single axis relative to the x-axis of the constraints' transform.
6Dof    - constrains the rotation of a rigid body with 6 Degrees of Freedom. Upper and lower limits can be set for both translation and rotation.

 / Activate \
Control the timing of rigid body activation. By default, an active rigid body responds to simulation forces starting on frame 1 - these controls can suspend activation until a specified frame.

|Frame Range
Set the starting and ending frames for activation.

|Axis Activation
Activate selected rigid bodies during the Frame Range along the specified axis.

+X    - activate rigid bodies along the +X axis.
-X    - activate rigid bodies along the -X axis.
+Y    - activate rigid bodies along the +Y axis.
-Y    - activate rigid bodies along the -Y axis.
+Z    - activate rigid bodies along the +Z axis.
-Z    - activate rigid bodies along the -Z axis.

|Radial Activation
Activate selected rigid bodies in an outward or inward radial pattern based on the active object in the selection.

Outward   - Radially activate rigid bodies outwards.
Inward    - Radially activate rigid bodies inwards.

|Remove Activation
Restore default active behavior (active on the start frame) or convert to passive (mass of 0).

Make Active    - Remove activation control and restore default active behavior.
Make Passive   - Remove activation control and convert to passive.


 / Bake \
Store simulation as keyframes and optimize the scene size. This operation is not undoable.

|Frame Range
Set the starting and ending frames for baking.

|Bake Operation
Bake keyframe data for selected or all rigid bodies in the scene.

Bake Selected  - Bake the motion of select rigid bodies as keyframes into the source meshes and delete the rigid bodies.
Bake All       - Bake the motion of all rigid bodies as keyframes into the source meshes and delete the rigid bodies.

|Options
Optimize Channels   - Reduce the number of keyframes stored in each animation channel (this can significantly reduce overhead)
Delete History      - Reduces the data attached to each baked body.
Delete Empty Nodes  - Eliminates orphaned and empty nodes


 / Options \
Control solver settings.
 
|Gravity
Direction and magnitude of gravity in the simulation.
 
|Physics Framerate (Hertz)
The 'speed' at which the simulation is advanced.
 
|Substeps
Number of times the simulation is evaluated "between" each frame step on the timeline. The default value of 1 should work for most simulations. Increasing this value can improve accuracy, but will generally reduce the framerate during playback.

|Collision Margin (creation only)
The gap around each collision shape used for collision detection. This value only effects Hull and Mesh rigid bodies during creation. Default is 0.040.

|Disable Collisions Between Constrained Bodies (creation only)
Controls the collisions of rigid bodies which share a constraint. This only effects constraints during creation.

|SplitImpulse
Enabling Split Impulse will allow the solver to apply positional corrections when deep collision penetrations occur. These corrections do not affect resulting velocities.

|Solver State
Toggles the state of the solver - like an on/off switch.
