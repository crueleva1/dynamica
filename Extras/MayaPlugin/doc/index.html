  <div class="title"> Introduction to Dynamica </div>
  <div class="term">Description</div>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>Dynamica is a rigid body simulation system for Autodesk Maya that uses the open source Bullet Physics framework. The Dynamica toolset allows users to create complex rigid body simulations which can be integrated into a wide range of production pipelines. The performance characteristics of the Bullet Physics framework allow large numbers of rigid bodies to be simulated at reasonable frame rates. This enables the rapid iteration needed to meet art direction requirements. With Dynamica, it is possible to work comfortably with thousands of simulated rigid bodies in a single scene.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="term">History</div>
  <div class="definition">Dynamica was originally developed at Walt Disney Animation Studios during the production of the animated feature film Bolt. The plugin source code was donated to the Bullet Physics project and is now distributed under the zLib license.  </div>

<div class="section-title">Basics</div>
  <div class="definition">The functionality is provided by four types of custom Maya nodes that interact with each other: <strong>dSolver</strong>, <strong>dRigidBody</strong>, <strong>dRigidBodyArray</strong>, and <strong>dCollisionShape</strong>. The different nodes can be created through the Dynamica UI. This UI can be accessed
  by clicking on the Bullet icon in the Dynamica shelf.</div>
  <div class="term">dSolver</div>
  <div class="definition">There is only one of these nodes per scene. It controls the global parameters of the simulation, such as time step, gravity, start frame, etc. It is created automatically every time a Rigid Body or a Rigid Body array is created.</div>
  <div class="term">dRigidBody</div>
  <div class="definition">There can be multiple rigid bodies in the scene. Each has different attributes that control behavior, such as mass, damping, 
    initial position/velocity, etc. 
    dRigidBodies can be active or passive. An active rigid body is controlled by the forces and collisions in the simulation. A passive rigid 
    body (sometimes called Kinematic) is static or key framed.</div>
  <div class="term">dCollisionShape</div>
  <div class="definition">Represents the shape that is used to compute the collisions between rigid bodies. Every rigid body connects to a collision shape.  
    It is recommended that collision shapes be a simple as possible to represent the desired collision behavior. The simpler the collision
    shape, the faster the simulation.
    Currently the collision shape available are: sphere, box, infinite plane, convex hull, mesh. The convex hull collision shape and the  
    mesh connect directly to a Maya mesh. The mesh collision shape is more precise for concave meshes, otherwise the convex hull shape should 
    be used, for faster simulation.</div>
  <div class="term">dRigidBodyArray</div>
  <div class="definition">Like a rigid body but can contain multiple rigid bodies sharing the same collision shape and simulation parameters. It's 
    the node of choice when the rigid bodies have the same shape and speed is required. The attributes that control the initial configuration are: <strong>NumRigidBodies</strong>, <strong>InitialPosition (Multi)</strong>, <strong>InitialRotation (Multi)</strong>, <strong>InitialVelocity (Multi)</strong>, <strong>InitialSpin (Multi). </strong></div>
  <div class="term">
      Constraints
</div>
  <div class="definition">
    Constraints inhibit the natural (unconstrained) behavior of an active rigid body. Constraints require a single rigid body or pair of rigid bodies to be selected. Rigid bodies can be influenced by multiple constraints.
  </div>
  <div class="section-title">
  Quick Start</div>
  <div class="definition">The following are simple examples that show the basic functionalities of Dynamica. All the commands can be accessed by clicking on the Bullet icon in the Dynamica shelf.</div>
  <p class="list-intro">To create a simple rolling sphere</p>
  <ol>
    <li> In the Dynamica UI, click on &quot;Create passive plane&quot;. It creates an infinite plane centered in (0,0,0). With the rotation manipulator,
      tilt the plane a little bit.</li>
    <li>Deselect the plane.
      Click on &quot;Create active sphere&quot;. It creates an active rigid body with a sphere as collision shape, centered in (0,0,0). With  
      the move manipulator, move it up to (0,10,0). (<strong>Important:</strong> when creating a rigid body, if something is selected, the newly created rigid body has it's 
      initial position and rotation set to the one of the selected object)</li>
    <li>Now roll back the time slider to the first frame and click play (Remember to extend the animation range as necessary). <br />
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="note"> Note: the simulation is re-initialized on the first frame of the scene - any changes made to the initial position or rotation of active rigid bodies in the viewport must be made on the first frame. </div>
  <p class="list-intro">To create a Dynamica rigid body with an arbitrary mesh</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Create a polygonal mesh in Maya, for example, an helix. With the helix still selected, click on &quot;Create active Mesh&quot;. A new rigid body is created, 
      with the helix as input to the Mesh collision shape. Alternatively, &quot;Create active Convex Hull&quot; could be used. The convex hull provides  
      faster simulations at the expense of less precise collisions (if the input mesh is convex, there is no difference between Convex Hull and Mesh
      collision shapes in terms of precision). </li>
    <li>Then repeat the same steps of the Simple rolling sphere example. </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="list-intro">To create a rigid body array</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Create a maya polygonal mesh in Maya, for example a torus. Resize the torus so that the size of the bounding box is around 1x1x1. </li>
    <li>With the torus still selected, hit &quot;Create Active Rigid Body Array&quot; in the UI. As small dialog box appears, asking for the dimensions    
      of the array and the offset between the rigid bodies. Enter (10, 20, 10) for the dimensions and (2.5, 2.5, 2.5) as offset.</li>
    <li>Create a passive plane as before, then translate the rigid body array so that all donuts are above the plane. </li>
    <li>Roll back the time slider to the first frame and click play.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="note"> The initial configuration of the rigid body array can be changed by modifying the proper attributes, for example with a mel script.
    The following is an example mel script that changes the initial configuration of a rigid body array:<br />
    <pre>
  
proc setConfiguration()
{
    //the name of the rigid body array node
    string $rigidBodyArray = &quot;myRigidBodyArray&quot;;    

    //set the number of bodies
    setAttr ($rigidBodyArray + &quot;.numBodies&quot;) (10 * 10 * 10);
    for($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
        for($j = 0; $j &lt; 10; $j++) {
            for($k = 0; $k &lt; 10; $k++) {
                //set the initial position
                setAttr ($children[0] + &quot;.initialPosition[&quot; + string($i + 10 * $j + 100 * $k) + &quot;]&quot;) ($i * 2) (10 + $k * 2) ($j * 2);

                //set the initial rotation to (0, 0, 0)
                setAttr ($children[0] + &quot;.initialRotation[&quot; + string($i + 10 * $j + 100 * $k) + &quot;]&quot;) 0 0 0;
            }
        }
    }
}

</pre>
  </div>
  <div class="term">Kinematic Objects</div>
  <div class="definition">Kinematic objects are animated by  keying the parent transform of a passive rigid body. If the  animation is really fast,
    it's possible that some objects will leak through the kinematic object. If rapid motion is required, try increasing the number of substeps in the Solver
    tab of the Dynamica UI or in the dSolver1 node and/or enabling split impulse. The substeps attribute is keyable, which makes it possible to set a different number of 
    substeps along the simulation. This allows users to fine tune the simulation, trading speed for accuracy.</div>

  <div class="title"> Dynamica In-Depth</div>
  <div class="definition">The Dynamica tools are organized in tabs within the Dynamica UI window.  The following sections describe each tab and the functions contained within.</div>
  <div class="section-title">Create</div>
  <div class="definition">The Create tab contains icon buttons which are used to create active and passive rigid bodies, rigid body arrays, and constraints. <img src="images/dynamica-UI-Create.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /> <div class="caption">Dynamica Create tab.</div></div>
  <div class="term">Active Rigid Bodies</div>
  <div class="definition">Active rigid bodies are controlled by the simulation solver and react to gravity, collisions, and fields.
    <ul>
      <li>Sphere - creates an active primitive rigid body sphere</li>
      <li>Box - creates an active primitive rigid body cube</li>
      <li>Plane - creates an active primitive rigid body plane</li>
      <li>Hull - creates an active rigid body hull based on a selected mesh object</li>
      <li>Mesh - creates an active rigid body mesh based on a selected mesh object</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="term">Passive Rigid Bodies</div>
  <div class="definition">Passive rigid bodies do not react to gravity or fields, but are included in collisions. They usually serve as proxy collision shapes for static surfaces in a scene. If passive rigid bodies are keyed and moving, active bodies will collide and react accordingly.
    <ul>
      <li>Sphere - creates a passive primitive rigid body sphere</li>
      <li>Box - creates a passive primitive rigid body cube</li>
      <li>Plane - creates a passive primitive rigid body plane</li>
      <li>Hull - creates a passive rigid body hull based on a selected mesh object</li>
      <li>Mesh - creates a passive rigid body mesh based on a selected mesh object</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="term">Active Rigid Body Arrays</div>
  <div class="definition">Active rigid body arrays are collections of like shaped active rigid bodies. The size of the array is controlled by user input in the Create Rigid Body Array panel:<img src="images/dynamica-create-rigid-body-array.jpg" width="408" height="127" alt="" /> <div class="caption">Create Rigid Body Array panel.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Sphere - creates an array of active primitive rigid body spheres</li>
      <li>Box - creates an array of active primitive rigid body cubes</li>
      <li>Plane - creates an array of active primitive rigid body planes</li>
      <li>Hull - creates an array of active  rigid body hulls based on a selected mesh object</li>
      <li>Mesh - creates an array of active rigid body meshes based on a selected mesh object</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">Note: rigid body arrays may not initially be visible if created on a frame other than the start frame .</div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="term">Passive Rigid Body Arrays</div>
  <div class="definition">These appear to be vestigial features and do not produce a predictable or obviously useful result. </div>
  <div class="term">Constraints</div>
  <div class="definition">Constraints inhibit the natural (unconstrained) behavior of an active rigid body. Constraints require a single rigid body or pair of rigid bodies to be selected. Rigid bodies can be influenced by multiple constraints.
    <ul>
      <li>Nail - pins a rigid body in place or to another rigid body and allows free rotation in any direction.</li>
      <li>Hinge - constrains a rigid body in place or to another rigid body and allows rotation about a single axis relative to the z-axis of the constraints transform. Hinges support automatic rotation via motor attributes.</li>
      <li>Slider - constrains the translation of a rigid body along a single axis relative to the x-axis of the constraints transform. </li>
      <li>6Dof - constrains the rotation of a rigid body with 6 Degrees of Freedom. Upper and lower limits can be set for both translation and rotation.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section-title">Solver</div>
  <div class="definition">The Solver tab exposes the primary attributes of the dSolver node. Additional dSolver attributes can be accessed via the Attribute Editor.<img src="images/dynamica-UI-Solver.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica Solver tab.</div></div>
  <div class="term">Solver Type</div>
  <div class="definition">Dynamica was originally designed to support multiple collision and physics solvers. The only available option is Bullet.</div>
  <div class="term">Gravity</div>
  <div class="definition">Controls the direction and magnitude of gravity. </div>
  <div class="term">Substeps</div>
  <div class="definition">This value controls the number of times the simulation is evaluated &quot;between&quot; each frame step on the timeline. The default value of 1 should work for most simulations. Increasing this value can improve accuracy, but will generally reduce the  framerate during playback.</div>
  <div class="term">Solver State</div>
  <div class="definition">Toggles the state of the solver - like an on/off switch.</div>
  <div class="term">Split Impulse</div>
  <div class="definition">Enabling Split Impulse will allow the solver to apply positional corrections when deep collision penetrations occur. These corrections do not affect resulting velocities.</div>
  <div class="section-title">Build</div>
  <div class="definition">The Build tab contains settings for creating multiple rigid bodies from a set of selected mesh objects. The source meshes  must have conformed outward-facing normals to prevent collision mesh distortion. When the Build process runs, each source mesh is parented to a corresponding Dynamica rigid body of the same topology, but scaled by a user specified collision margin. This configuration allows for visually accurate collisions without popping or gaps. The default collision margin of -0.060 should produce accurate collisions for most geometry. <img src="images/dynamica-UI-Build.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica Build tab.</div></div>
  <div class="term">Rigid Body Type</div>
  <div class="definition">This setting specifies that the resulting rigid bodies be either <strong>Active </strong>or <strong>Passive</strong>. If passive is selected, optional Processing Options are enabled (see next item).</div>
  <div class="term">Processing Options</div>
  <div class="definition">If Rigid Body Type is set to passive and the Preserve Keyframes box is checked (default), any pre-existing transform key frames will be preserved and the resulting rigid bodies will be animated according to those keys. </div>
  <div class="term">Collision Type</div>
  <div class="definition">Controls the creation of collision shapes based on the source geometry. Hull is default and recommended for performance reasons. Mesh can be selected to force the solver to respect any concave surfaces - at the expense of slower solve times.</div>
  <div class="term">Collision Margin</div>
  <div class="definition">Specifies an offset value by which the source geometry is scaled to compensate for built-in collision tolerances. This results in visually accurate collisions free of visible gaps. The default value of -0.060 should be suitable for most applications.</div>
  <div class="term">
    Build Rigid Bodies (button)
  </div>
  <div class="definition">Builds rigid bodies from the current selection using the options above.</div>
  <div class="section-title">Constrain</div>
  <div class="definition">The Constrain tab contains settings for constraining multiple selected rigid bodies to each other. Each of the standard four constraint types is supported and can be created according to four search methods: Nearest Neighbor, Farthest Neighbor, Random, and Axis. <img src="images/dynamica-UI-Constrain.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica Constrain tab.</div></div>
  <div class="term">Constraint Type</div>
  <div class="definition">Specifies the type of constraint to be created between rigid bodies. Select from one of four options: <strong>Nail</strong>, <strong>Hinge</strong>, <strong>Slider</strong>, and <strong>6Dof</strong>.</div>
  <div class="term">Search Method</div>
  <div class="definition"> Each search method pairs rigid bodies from the selection in a different way. The options are <strong>Nearest Neighbor</strong>, <strong>Farthest Neighbor</strong>, <strong>Random</strong>, and <strong>Axis</strong>.</div>
  <div class="term">Number of Neighbors</div>
  <div class="definition">This option is only available when Nearest Neighbor or Farthest Neighbor is selected as the Search Method. The specified value (default is 1) controls how many constraints are connected to each rigid body. </div>
  <div class="term">Axis Direction</div>
  <div class="definition">This  becomes active when Axis is selected as the Search Method. Options include <strong>+X</strong>, <strong>-X</strong>, <strong>+Y</strong>, <strong>-Y</strong>, <strong>+Z</strong>, and <strong>-Z</strong>. Constraints are created in chain-like succession along the specified axis.</div>
  <div class="term">Delete Constraints (button)</div>
  <div class="definition">This should be used to delete any unwanted constraints created with the above options. Deleting constraints manually with the delete key will not remove all dependencies, resulting in inefficiency and errors.</div>
  <div class="term">Constrain Rigid Bodies (button)</div>
  <div class="definition">Creates constraints among selected rigid bodies using the options above.</div>
  <div class="section-title">Activate/Break</div>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>The Activate/Break tab  is used to control the timing of rigid body activation and constraint deactivation (breaking). By default, an active rigid body responds to simulation forces starting on frame 1 and constraints remain active continuously. These tools can prevent this behavior and instead suspend simulation or break constraints on a specified frame. Both single frame and multi frame activation are supported, the latter being useful for creating progressive activation effects such as a crumbling wall, radial fracture, or sporadic structural failure (to name just a few).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Three Input Methods (Axis Gradient, Radial Gradient, and 3D Texture) are supported in Multi Frame mode to control the timing of rigid body activation during the specified frame range. Additionally, enabling Compute Mass and specifying a density value can increase the realism of rigid body interactions by computing mass based on bounding box volume.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Applying  activation adds two attributes to each  rigid body - activateFrame and activateMass. These are used by an expression node to control the mass attribute of the rigid body shape. A mass of 0 effectively turns the active rigid body into a passive rigid body, while a non-zero value re-activates it. The expression sets the rigid body mass to the value of activateMass when activateFrame is reached on the timeline. Setting activateFrame to 0 effectively disables activation. These attributes can also be edited via the Channel Box or Attribute Spread Sheet if fine adjustments are necessary.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Constraint breaking works in a similar way. An constraintBreakFrame attribute is added to each rigid body bound by constraints. An expression compares the value of this attribute to the current frame during playback - when the two match, the constraint is deleted, freeing the rigid body.</p>
    <p><img src="images/dynamica-UI-Activate-single.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /></p><div class="caption">Dynamica Activate/Break tab.</div></p>
  </div>
  <div class="term">Activate/Break</div>
  <div class="definition">This option specifies the type of object to operate on: <strong>Rigid Bodies</strong>, <strong>Constraints</strong>, or <strong>Auto</strong>.</div>
  <div class="note">Note: Constraits will not break or reset correctly if the Dynamica window has not been opened. </div>
  <div class="term">Control Method</div>
  <div class="definition">Options are Single Frame or Multi Frame. Single Frame (default) enables the Start frame field below. Multi Frame enables both the Start and End frame fields, and the Input Method options.</div>
  <div class="term">Start/End Frame</div>
  <div class="definition">These fields control the frame range over which activation/breaking will occur.</div>
  <div class="term">Compute Mass</div>
  <div class="definition">Enabling this option will compute an approximate mass value for each rigid body based on the bounding box volume. This can be used in combination with the Density field to simulate different monolithic material types i.e. stone is denser than wood. </div>
  <div class="note">Note: This can produce inaccurate results for oblong or slender shapes. This generally does not create significant problems, but the activateMass attribute can be edited manually if needed.</div>
  <div class="term">Density</div>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>This field remains inactive unless Compute Mass is checked. The density value (default is 1.000) is multiplied by the computed mass. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="term">Input Method (Multi Frame Mode)</div>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>Three options are available when the Multi Frame Control Method is enabled: <strong>Axis Gradient</strong>, <strong>Radial Gradient</strong>, and <strong>3D Texture</strong>. Each of these input methods use the Start/End frame range to control when rigid bodies activate or constraints break. </p>
    <p class="term">Axis Gradient</p>
    <div class="definition">Axis Gradient will progressively activate rigid bodies or break constraints along the selected Axis Direction (<strong>+X</strong>, <strong>-X</strong>, <strong>+Y</strong>, <strong>-Y</strong>, <strong>+Z</strong>, or <strong>-Z</strong>.) during the Start/End Frame range.<img src="images/dynamica-UI-Activate-multi-axis.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica Activate/Break tab - Axis Gradient Input Method.</div></div>
    <p class="term">Radial Gradient</p>
    <div class="definition">
      Radial Gradient will progressively activate rigid bodies or break constraints away from, or converging toward, a single focal point. A reference object in the scene serves as the focal point from which a spherical activation gradient is created. The Search Radius can be set via Numeric Input or automatically (based on the reference object's bounding volume). rigid bodies and constraints within the Search Radius are activated/broken outward by default, or inward if the Inverted option is checked. activation/breaking proceeds linearly during the Start/End Frame range.

    <p>The Bake tab is used to bake all or part of the simulation into keyframes within the user specified frame range. Optionally, construction history, static channels, and empty nodes can be deleted (this is recommended). The process begins by copying the scene to a new file of the same name, but with _BAKED appended to the filename (i.e. dynamicaScene1.mb -&gt; dynamicaScene1_BAKED.mb). A valid Project workspace must be active. </p><div class="note">Note: pre-existing _BAKED files can be optionally overwritten - this allows a scene to be baked in stages.</div></p>

    <p>To minimize memory usage, Undo is temporarily disabled and only translation and rotation are stored as keyframes. It is also recommended that history, static channels, and empty nodes be deleted during post processing. Maya RigidBody nodes (not the same as Dynamica rigid bodies!) are automatically deleted during this process - these result from using fields to influence Dynamica rigid bodies. Using recommended settings results in a clean efficient scene ready for the next phase of production.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Baked scenes can be used as the basis for continued production. Baked objects can be converted back into passive rigid bodies using Build options. This allows content creators to build scenes containing many thousands of simulated rigid bodies.</p>

  <div class="section-title">
    Tools &amp; Pipeline
  </div>
  <div class="term">The Tools</div>
  <div class="definition"> 
    <p>The Dynamica tools are designed to address the demanding needs of art directors who often require many iterations of a shot with specific choreographies - all in a short period of time. In order to meet these needs, the simulation artist must have a high degree of control over the simulation and the ability to iterate rapidly. Features such as axis and radial activation, automatic constraint generation, and optimized baking support these rapid workflows. Dynamica also takes advantage of Maya's native scene management features  to keep the simulation organized.</p>
</div>
  <div class="term">The Pipeline</div>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>It's important to understand how Dynamica workflows fit into the production pipeline. Dynamica rigid bodies serve a single specialized purpose - physically accurate behavior in the presence of forces and constraints. Unlike typical objects and animation systems in Maya, <strong>Dynamica simulations and rigid bodies are not renderable unless geometry is parented to each body and then baked into keyed motion</strong>. This means that simulations should be created and edited in their own scenes, baked, and then integrated into the next phase of production.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This &quot;restriction&quot; actually proves to be quite flexible in practice. Let's say that you are responsible for a shot involving a 19th century naval battle. You are charged with simulating the physical destruction of a ship due to canon fire and an explosion. The art director sends you a single concept image and specifies 9 canon shots from the enemy ship successively penetrate the hull with the final shot detonating the munitions store. The explosion rips through the deck and  hull, shredding the sails, toppling the mast, and setting everything ablaze.</p>
    <p><img src="images/JeremyLoveColdrumNapoleonicBattle.jpg" width="800" height="435" alt="© Jeremy Love a.k.a Coldrum EOW winner - Napoleonic Battle" longdesc="http://www.jeremylove.com" /> </p><div class="caption"><a href="http://www.jeremylove.com/" target="_blank">© Jeremy Love</a> - conceptart.org Environment of the Week 117 winner.</div>
    The final rendered sequence will eventually be composited into live action plates. Let's assume that the plates have been matchmoved and 3D models of the ship are complete. You must now pre-shatter the models, build the rigid body simulation, and animate all the rope and cloth. Since there will be much smoke, fire, and atmospherics obscuring the action, you can assume  minimal interaction between the rigids and the &quot;soft sims&quot; will be sufficient - this means you can build the sim in steps: rigid bodies first, then rope and cloth. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="term">Step 1: Prep</div>
    <div class="definition">The models need to be pre-shattered and possibly proxied if detail levels are too high. Voronoi shatter is a common starting point to produce uniformly proportioned fragments. The Dynamica PolyCutter tool can then be used to fine tune the fragment shapes and sizes - adding detail where needed and creating seams along plank edges, openings, and other structural elements.</div>
    <div class="term">Step 2: Dynamica Simulation</div>
    <div class="definition">
      <p>Let's assume a total fragment count of 50,000. Let's also assume that the art director needs to sign off on all the details of the simulation, approving each canonball impact along the way. You can start with the first impact by converting all the associated fragments into Dynamica rigid bodies, adding a field or two (radial and turbulence should do it), and editing a multi frame activation sequence. When the art director signs off on your work, you can bake the sequence and move onto the next shot - converting the previous sim into keyed passives if necessary. After the entire rigid sim is built and baked, you can then add the cloth and rope (using Maya nCloth perhaps), using the keyed rigids as colliders to create dynamic interaction and add to realism. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="term">Step 3: Push it Down the Pipe</div>
    <div class="definition">After all the sim work is done you should have a scene or series of scenes that contain nothing but baked and cached objects. These assets are then pushed down the pipe - possibly to the particles and fluids team for fire, smoke, and debris, or maybe to the texture and paint team for shading.</div>
  This process of simulation, iteration, and baking allows the Dynamica workflow to be integrated into a wide range of production scenarios.</div>
  <div class="term">Examples</div>
  <div class="definition"> Another powerful production feature provided by the Dynamica toolset is the ability to blend activation types. Examples include: 
    <ul>
      <li>A Radial Gradient could be used to create crumbling from a local impact and a series of Axis Gradients could then be used to control secondary fracturing caused by the impact.</li>
      <li>3D Texure activation can simulate the effects of random structural failure from fire or earthquake. Axis Gradients could be combined with this effect to control the timing and behavior of structural collapse.</li>
      <li>An Axis Gradient can create a vertically progressing fracture on a surface and then areas of the surface can be disabled to maintain structural integrity.</li></ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section-title">Tutorials</div>
  <div class="definition"> The following tutorials cover basic workflows and illustrate how to use the toolset.</div>
    <div class="term">100 Cubes</div>
    <div class="definition">
      <p>This workflow will demonstrate rigid body creation, activation, and baking.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with a new scene in Maya. Create ten standard size polygon cubes (disable interactive creation if needed). Distribute them along the X axis, one unit apart.</li>
        <li>Duplicate the set of ten cubes ten times, moving them up (+Y) one unit each time. You should now have a 10 x 10 set of cubes.</li>
        <li>Move them up (+Y) off the reference grid  7 or 8 units.<img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-01.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">10 x 10 set of cubes arranged along the x-axis and 7-8 units above the reference grid.</div></li>
        <li>Find the Dynamica shelf and click on the Bullet icon. This opens the main Dynamica window.<img src="images/dynamica-shelf.jpg" width="749" height="51" alt="Dynamica Shelf" /><div class="caption">Dynamica shelf and Bullet icon.</div></li>
        <li>Click on the Create tab. Under Passive Rigid Bodies, click Plane. An XZ plane named dRigidBody1 appears in the scene centered at the origin. This will serve as a ground collision surface. You can optionally hide this object to make selecting the other objects easier. Hiding it from view will NOT hide it from the simulation.<img src="images/dynamica-UI-Create-Passive-Plane.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica window, Create tab, Passive Rigid Body section, click Plane.</div><img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-02.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Passive XZ Plane centered at the origin.</div></li>
        <li>Select the cubes. In the Dynamica window, select the Build tab. Leave the settings at their defaults and click the Build Rigid Bodies button at the bottom of the window.<br />
          <br />
        If the viewport is in wireframe mode, you will see slightly smaller triangulated cubes inside the original polygon cubes - the gap between each cube represents the collision margin. In the Outliner, two new groups have appeared - dRigidBodies and dCollisionMeshes. The dRigidBodies group holds the generated dRigidBody objects - which are parents to the original polygon cubes. In the dCollisionMeshes group you will find polygon objects that were generated from the Margin setting in the Build options - these are the surfaces from which the dRigidBodies were created.<br />
        <br />
        You will also find two Display Layers - DynamicaMeshes and DynamicaRigidBodies. The DynamicaMeshes layer holds the original polygon cubes - it's display mode is set to Reference - to make selection of the dRigidBodies in the viewport easier. You can hide this layer to see only the dRigidBody objects. The DynamicaRigidBodies layer holds the dRigidBody objects - you can select them here via right-clicking and choosing Select All from the popup menu.<br />

        <li>Set the playback range to 1 - 200 frames, set the timer slider to frame 1, and click the Play button. The cubes repel each other slightly, fall along the -Y axis, and visibly collide with the ground plane (whether or not it's hidden).<img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-05.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Results after playing the scene from frame 1. Results may vary slightly.</div></li>
        <li> Set the time slider back to frame 1 - the cubes snap back to their original locations. Click on the Activate tab at the top of the Dynamica window. Note the default settings. Click the Activate/Break Rigid Bodies and Constraints button at the bottom of the window.<img src="images/dynamica-UI-ActivateRBs.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica window, Activate/Break tab, Acticate/Break: Rigid Bodies, Control Method: Single Frame, Start/End Frame: 24/[disabled].</div></li>
        <li>Click the Play button. The cubes remain static until frame 24 and then fall to the ground plane. Look back at the Dynamica window, the default  settings specify Single Frame activation of  Rigid Bodies starting on frame 24. This is why the cubes remained inactive until frame 24.</li>
        <li>Select one of the cubes and open the Channel Box. Note the extra attributes: <strong>activateFrame</strong> and <strong>activateMass</strong>. The value of activateFrame determines when the rigid body becomes active while the value of activateMass specifies the mass of the rigid body when it becomes active.<img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-06.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Channel Box showing extra attributes activateFrame and activateMass.</div></li>
        <li>Set the time slider to frame 1 and select the cubes. In the Dynamica window under the Activate/Break tab, select Multi Frame for the Control Method. New options appear below and the End Frame field is enabled. By default the Input Method is set to Axis Gradient. Note the default Axis Direction of +X and click the Activate/Break Rigid Bodies and Constraints button at the bottom of the window.<img src="images/dynamica-UI-ActivateRBs2.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica window, Activate/Break tab, Acticate/Break: Rigid Bodies, Control Method: Multi Frame, Start/End Frame: 24/48, Input Method: Axis Gradient, Axis Direction: +X.</div></li>
        <li>Click the Play button. The cubes remain static until frame 24 and then progressively fall along the +X axis. Set the playhead to frame 1 and click the play button again - this time note that the cubes start to fall on frame 24 and end on frame 48. This happens because the frame range specifed for Start/End Frame starts at 24 and ends at 48. Open the Channel Box. Select the cubes one at a time and note the value of the activateFrame attribute.</li>
        <li>Select one of the cubes and set it's activeFrame attribute in the Channel Box to 0. Leave this object selected.</li>
        <li>Set the time slider to frame 1 and click the Play button. Note the selected cube no longer falls. Setting activeFrame to 0 effectively disables activation.<img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-07.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Channel Box showing activateFrame attribute value of 0 - this disables activation.</div></li>
        <li>Set the time slider to frame 1 and select the top row of cubes. Under the Activate/Break tab, click the Deactivate Dynamica Rigid Bodies and Constraints. This sets the activateFrame attribute of all selected rigid bodies to 0.<img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-08.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Top row of cubes selected.</div><img src="images/dynamica-UI-deactivate.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica window, Activate/Break tab,  click Deactivate Dynamica Rigid Bodies and Constraints button</div></li>
        <li>Click the play button. The top row of cubes remain static because their activeFrame attributes are all set to 0.</li>
        <li>Select the Bake tab in the Dynamica window. Leave the Bake option set to All dRigidBodies, set the Start/End Frame to 1/200, leave the Post Processing Options at their defaults, and click the Bake Rigid Bodies button. <br />
          <br />
          If you have not saved the scene yet, an error message will appear in the command line directing you to save the scene into a valid Maya project. Once the scene is saved, click the Bake Rigid Bodies button and a Save Scene dialog box will appear asking if you want to save the scene before baking. Choose yes or no.<br /><br />
        The scene will reset and then play back frame by frame baking the transforms of each rigid body. The scene has been saved under a new filename with the suffix &quot;_BAKED&quot;. There is also a new group named dBaked which contains the baked meshes and a new Display Layer named DynamicaBaked which controls their display styles. <img src="images/dynamica-UI-bakescene.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica window, Bake tab, click Bake Rigid Bodies.</div></li>
        <li>Select one of the moving cubes and look at the time slider. A key tick is visible on every frame from 1 to 200. The motion of each cube is now controlled by keys rather than forces and collisions. Because Delete Static Channels was enabled, the static cubes along the top row have no keys.<img src="images/100-Cubes-Screen-09.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" />

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The resulting baked scene can now be sent down the pipeline or used as the basis for continued simulation. The baked cubes can be used as passive colliders or mesh emitters for additional rigid body, cloth, particle, or fluid simulation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Things to keep in mind while working with rigid bodies:</p>
      <div class="note"><ul>
        <li>Optimum collision margin settings will vary depending on the size and shape of the geometry involved. higher collision margins (up to and above 0) will cause the rigid bodies to repel each other when active - this can be desirable for explosions and forceful impacts, but it can produce visible collision gaps.</li>
        <li>Very small rigid bodies may not behave as expected. Dramatic penetrations can occur with very small collision shapes - resulting in erratic behavior. If a mixture of scale is needed such as crumbling walls and breaking glass, sim the large objects first then sim the smaller objects at a larger scale - after baking, objects can be scaled in groups and sped up if necessary.</li>

      <li>In a new scene create a standard sized poly cylinder. Set it's X and Z scale to 0.25.<img src="images/simple-chain-01.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Standard sized poly cylinder with X and Z scale set to 0.25.</div></li>
      <li>Duplicate it 7 times and distribute each cylinder 3 units apart along the +Y axis (hint: pressing the j key before manipulating objects will engage transform snapping). You should have 8 cylinders total.<img src="images/simple-chain-02.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">8 poly cylinders distributed 3 units apart along the +Y axis.</div></li>
      <li>With the cylinders selected, click on the Build tab in the Dynamica window. Leave the options at their defaults and click the Build Rigid Bodies button.</li>
      <li>Set the playback range to 1 - 300 frames and click play. The rigid bodies fall along the -Y axis. </li>
      <li>Set the time slider back to frame 1. In the Display Layers panel, ensure that the DynamicaMeshes layer is set to reference mode and the DynamicaRigidBodies layer is set to normal.<img src="images/display-layers-01.jpg" width="271" height="211" alt="" /><div class="caption">Display Layers</div></li>
      <li>Again select the cubes in the viewport. This time, the rigid bodies are selected instead of the original meshes. click the Constrain tab in the Dynamica window. Leave the Constrain Type set to Nail, select Axis for the Search Method, and set Axis Direction to +Y. Click the Constrain Rigid Bodies button. <br />
        <br />
      Constrains appear in the scene connecting each rigid body to the next along the +Y axis. A new display layer named DynamicaConstraints has also appeared in the Display Layers panel.<img src="images/dynamica-UI-constrain-Y.jpg" width="528" height="476" alt="" /><div class="caption">Dynamica window, Constrain tab.

      <li>Select the rigid body at the top of the chain. In the channel box, set it's mass attribute to 0.

      <li>Set the time slider to frame 50, translate the cube to -12 along the X axis and set another key frame. Rewind and play back the scene. The cube moves along the -X axis and passes through the rigid body at the bottom of the chain.</li>
      <li>Click the Build tab in the Dynamica window. Select Passive for Rigid Body Type and leave the Preserve Keyframes box checked. Click the Build Rigid Bodies button.

      <li>The constraints are connected at the center pivot of each rigid body which results in odd behavior. Set the time slider to frame 1.

      <li>Set the time slider to frame 1 and click the play button. The cube impacts the chain and breaks it in two. The previously selected constraint disappears as the two pieces separate. This is how constraint breaking works - constraints are removed according to the activate/break parameters specified.<img src="images/simple-chain-11.jpg" width="700" height="380" alt="" /><div class="caption">Constraint breaking causes chain to snap.</div></li>
    </ol>
    <p>:)</p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Constraint breaking can be used to carefully control and choreograph simulations to meet the challenges of art direction. Combining rigid body activation with constraint breaking can produce complex and compelling results.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Things to keep in mind when working with constraints:</p>
    <div class="note"><ul>
      <li>Binding many tightly fit rigid bodies with constraints can cause erratic behavior. This happens because the rigid bodies are trying to respect each other's boundaries while the constraints are trying to hold everything in place - this results in forced penetration which can cause high velocity corrections. To remedy this, try using the Farthest Neighbor Search Method when generating constraints and/or Enabling Split Impulse.</li>
      <li>6Dof constraints are best suited for maintaining the orientation of connected rigid bodies.</li>
